DayPlanner is a editable web application capable of recording the user scheudle by the hour. The time is provided dynamically by moment.js and is presented to the user at the top of the screen. Nine sections of input fields, labeled like a typically workday from the hours of 9AM to 5PM, can be edited by the user. A save button is added to record the user's scheduled blocks of time even after the browser is refreshed. DayPlanner is hosted on GitHub and is designed to be mobile responsive.
